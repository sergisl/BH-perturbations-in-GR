# ringdown-calculations
A collection of notebooks for black-hole-perturbation calculations in GR and modified gravity.

- [BH-perturbations-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/BH-perturbations-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action.

- [BH-perturbations-Horndeski](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/BH-perturbations-Horndeski.nb): derivation of 3 master equations (gravitational odd, gravitational even, scalar even) for a Schwarzschild black hole in Horndeski gravity.

- [Testing-speed-gravity-BH-ringdown](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Testing-speed-gravity-BH-ringdown.nb): companion notebook to the paper [2212.XXXX].
