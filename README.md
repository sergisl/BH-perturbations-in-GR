# ringdown-calculations
A collection of notebooks for black hole perturbation calculations in GR and modified gravity.

- [BH-perturbations-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/BH-perturbations-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action. (*Very user friendly*)

- [BH-perturbations-Horndeski](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/BH-perturbations-Horndeski.nb): derivation of 3 master equations (gravitational odd, gravitational even, scalar even) for a Schwarzschild black hole in Horndeski gravity. (*Very user friendly*)
