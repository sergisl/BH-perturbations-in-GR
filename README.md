# ringdown-calculations
A collection of notebooks for black hole perturbation calculations in modified gravity.

- [BH-perturbation-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/BH-perturbations-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action.
